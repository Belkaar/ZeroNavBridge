# ZeroNavBridge
This is an Android app that reads navigation instructions from Kurviger and Google Maps and sends it via Bluetooth to a Zero Motorcycles Bike (Cipher III).

## Usage

## Privacy
The app does not store any data besides the selected settings. It does not make any network requests. It does not access files on your phone.
To use the Google Maps integration the app needs access to your notifications. It only reads notifications from Google Maps that contain navigation instructions. It does not save notification data.
